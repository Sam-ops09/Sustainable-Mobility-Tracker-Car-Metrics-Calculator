## Introduction

The Fuel Consumption Prediction Web Application is built using Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to input vehicle specifications and get predictions for CO2 emissions.

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/fuel-consumption-prediction.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd fuel-consumption-prediction
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the Flask application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

5. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, users can:

- Input vehicle specifications (engine size, cylinders, fuel consumption) in the provided form.
- Receive predictions for CO2 emissions based on the selected machine learning model.

### Error Rate Reduction

To reduce error rates and improve prediction accuracy, the following strategies were implemented:

- **Model Selection**: The application uses a Voting Regressor ensemble model that combines multiple machine learning models, including linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, elastic net regression, neural network regression, XGBoost regression, and random forest regression. By leveraging the strengths of different models, the ensemble model aims to minimize errors and provide more accurate predictions.

- **Default Prediction**: If the given input does not exist in the dataset or input values don't match, the application provides a default prediction using a selected model (e.g., linear regression). This helps handle edge cases and ensures users receive predictions even in scenarios where input data is incomplete or unavailable.

### Accuracy Improvement

To improve prediction accuracy, the following techniques were employed:

- **Outlier Handling**: Outliers in the fuel consumption data were identified and handled to prevent them from negatively impacting the model's performance. The `handle_outliers` function utilizes z-scores to identify outliers and replaces them with the median value. This preprocessing step helps improve the accuracy of predictions by reducing the influence of outlier data points.

### Handling Outliers

Outliers in the fuel consumption data were handled using the `handle_outliers` function, which follows these steps:

1. **Calculate Z-Scores**: Z-scores are calculated for the data using the formula `(data - mean) / standard deviation`.

2. **Identify Outliers**: Data points with absolute z-scores greater than a specified threshold (default is 3) are considered outliers.

3. **Replace Outliers**: Outliers are replaced with the median value of the data. This helps mitigate the impact of outliers on model training and prediction.
