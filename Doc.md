## Introduction

The Fuel Consumption Prediction Web Application is designed using Flask, a versatile and lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python. It provides a user-friendly interface enabling users to input specific vehicle details and obtain predictions for CO2 emissions.

## Installation

Follow these steps to run the application locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/fuel-consumption-prediction.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd fuel-consumption-prediction
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the Flask Application:**

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

5. **Access the Application:**

    Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage

Upon launching the application, users can:

- Input vehicle specifications (engine size, cylinders, fuel consumption) in the provided form.
- Receive predictions for CO2 emissions based on the selected machine learning model.

### Error Rate Reduction

To minimize error rates and enhance prediction accuracy, the following strategies were implemented:

- **Model Selection:** The application uses a Voting Regressor ensemble model, combining various machine learning models such as linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression, elastic net regression, neural network regression, XGBoost regression, and random forest regression. This ensemble approach aims to leverage the strengths of different models, contributing to a reduction in errors and more accurate predictions.

- **Default Prediction:** In cases where the provided input does not exist in the dataset or input values don't match, the application generates a default prediction using a selected model (e.g., linear regression). This ensures users receive predictions even when input data is incomplete or unavailable.

### Accuracy Improvement

To boost prediction accuracy, the following techniques were employed:

- **Outlier Handling:** Outliers within the fuel consumption data were identified and addressed to prevent their adverse effects on model performance. The `handle_outliers` function utilizes z-scores to identify outliers and subsequently replaces them with the median value. This preprocessing step enhances the accuracy of predictions by mitigating the impact of outlier data points.

### Handling Outliers

Outliers within the fuel consumption data are handled via the `handle_outliers` function, employing the following steps:

1. **Calculate Z-Scores:** Z-scores are computed for the data using the formula `(data - mean) / standard deviation`.

2. **Identify Outliers:** Data points with absolute z-scores exceeding a specified threshold (default is 3) are classified as outliers.

3. **Replace Outliers:** Outliers are substituted with the median value of the data. This approach helps alleviate the influence of outliers on model training and prediction, contributing to improved accuracy.

### Model Integration

The machine learning models are integrated into the application using the `VotingRegressor` from scikit-learn. Follow these steps to integrate additional models:

1. **Train the Model:**
   - Train the new machine learning model using your dataset.

2. **Save the Model:**
   - Save the trained model using the `pickle` library. For example:
     ```python
     with open('new_model.pkl', 'wb') as model_file:
         pickle.dump(new_model, model_file)
     ```

3. **Update the Application:**
   - Update the `model_names` list in the `app.py` file to include the name of your new model.
   - Load the new model in the `models` dictionary:
     ```python
     with open('new_model.pkl', 'rb') as model_file:
         models['new_model'] = pickle.load(model_file)
     ```

4. **Run the Application:**
   - Restart the Flask application to incorporate the new model.
