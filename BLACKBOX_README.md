# Sustainable-Mobility-Tracker-Car-Metrics-Calculator

This repository contains the code for a car metrics calculator that can be used to track the sustainability of a vehicle. The calculator takes into account a variety of factors, including the vehicle's fuel efficiency, emissions, and weight.

## How to use the calculator

To use the calculator, simply enter the following information:

* The vehicle's make and model
* The vehicle's fuel type
* The vehicle's fuel efficiency (in miles per gallon)
* The vehicle's emissions (in grams of CO2 per mile)
* The vehicle's weight (in pounds)

The calculator will then use this information to calculate the vehicle's sustainability score. The score is a number between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most sustainable.

## Code snippets

The following code snippets show how to use the calculator:

```python
# Import the necessary libraries
import requests
import json

# Get the vehicle's make and model
make = input("Enter the vehicle's make: ")
model = input("Enter the vehicle's model: ")

# Get the vehicle's fuel type
fuel_type = input("Enter the vehicle's fuel type: ")

# Get the vehicle's fuel efficiency
fuel_efficiency = input("Enter the vehicle's fuel efficiency (in miles per gallon): ")

# Get the vehicle's emissions
emissions = input("Enter the vehicle's emissions (in grams of CO2 per mile): ")

# Get the vehicle's weight
weight = input("Enter the vehicle's weight (in pounds): ")

# Calculate the vehicle's sustainability score
sustainability_score = calculate_sustainability_score(make, model, fuel_type, fuel_efficiency, emissions, weight)

# Print the vehicle's sustainability score
print("The vehicle's sustainability score is:", sustainability_score)
```

## Step-by-step explanation of the code

The following is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The first step is to import the necessary libraries. In this case, we are importing the `requests` and `json` libraries.
2. The next step is to get the vehicle's make and model. This is done by calling the `input()` function and prompting the user to enter the vehicle's make and model.
